## Introduction

2)  Introduction

-   Questions of interest along with real-world motivation

    -   In the original study, the neural activity of 30,000 neurons in 42 brain regions of mice were analyzed. There were 10 mice analyzed over 39 different sessions. Within each session, visual stimuli were presented to the mice at random, then the reaction of the mice to this stimuli were recorded.
    -   In this project, we will be analyzing the different trials and recorded neuron spikes in order to make a predictive model.

-   Impact of results

-   Basic information of data (source, key variables, hypotheses), method, and why.

    -   The data comes from 18 different session of 4 different mice brain neural activity. The four mice that we are studying the neural responses of are Cori, Forssmann, Hench, and Lederberg. More specifically, the first three sessions analyzed Cori, the next four Forssmann, the next four Hench, and the last seven Lederberg. These sessions were taken between 12/14/2016 through 12/11/2017.

    -   Within each session, there were many trials where the activity of the neurons in the mice's visual cortex was recorded based on their decision making when faced with visual stimuli. Their decision making consists of turning the wheel either to the left or right or holding it still. Different variables were recorded for the 4 different mice. 8 variables are recorded each session:

        -   brain_area: The area of the brain where each neuron lives.
        -   contrast_left: Contrast on the left stimulus. Can take values 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 (0 indicating the absence of a stimulus).
        -   contrast_right: Contrast on the right stimulus. Can take values 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 (0 indicating the absence of a stimulus).
        -   date_exp: Date of the experiment on the mouse.
        -   feedback_type: The type of feedback that was administered base on the outcome of the mouse's decision. There are four different cases that can happen:
            -   When the right contrast is greater than the left contrast: If the mouse turned the wheel to the left, feedback_type = 1. If turned to the right, feedback_type = -1.
            -   When the left contrast is greater than the right contrast: If the mouse turned the wheel to the right, feedback_type = 1. If turned to the left, feedback_type = -1.
            -   When the left contrast and right contrast equal 0: If mouse held the wheel still, feedback_type = 1. Otherwise, feedback_type = -1.
            -   When the left contrast and right contrast are equal and not both 0: There is a 50% chance that feedback_type = 1 or -1.
        -   mouse_name: Name of the mouse being used in the experiment (trial). Specific to this project, the 4 mice are Cori, Forssmann, Hench, and Lederberg.
        -   spks: Numbers of spikes of neurons in the visual cortex. Holds many different trials.
        -   time: Center of the time bins for the spks.

-   Existing research and known results
