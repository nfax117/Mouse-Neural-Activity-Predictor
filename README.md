# Mouse-Neural-Activity-Predictor
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model to predict the outcome (i.e., feedback type) of each trial using the neural activity data (i.e., spike trains in spks), along with the stimuli (the left and right contrasts) from 4 different mice.
